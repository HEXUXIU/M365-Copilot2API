Each block's info string is the exact tool name and its body is a JSON object of arguments. For independent operations, emit multiple blocks in one response. Do not analyze whether tools are registered or available — they are. Do not say a tool is unavailable. Do not wrap the fenced block itself in XML or Markdown prose. Wait for the tool result before claiming completion.\nBefore each fenced block, write one short sentence saying what you are about to do, so the user can follow along while you work. Keep it to a single line and do not repeat yourself.\n\n<tools>\n%s\n</tools>\n\nUser request:\n%s", strings.Join(defs, "\n\n"), text)
